					<h3 class="emphasis">Introduction: Lab-Centered Instruction</h3>

					<p>Whether it is in academia or industry, in computer simulations or at a physical bench, electronics engineering is centered around lab work. Thus, while undergraduate students (even in engineering) might expect to sit passively in a lecture, when they enter my classroom, they are learning to live the lab experience. This is not to say my only teaching experience is in lab courses, although I have served as a TA in such settings. Rather, I view every component of instruction as an opportunity for lab activity.</p>

				<div class="details">

					<p>Why? Because the lab is the setting that best captures the key learning goals of engineering as a whole: students must use their theoretical knowledge to build a solution to an engineering problem, then characterize their solution using appropriate measurements and communicate the results to other engineers. Explicit in this process is the requirement that students <em>produce something</em>, which is a more difficult and more meaningful task than the passive understanding and identification of concepts associated with a lecture.</p>
