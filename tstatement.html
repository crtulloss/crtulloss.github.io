					<h3 class="emphasis">Introduction: Lab-Centered Instruction</h3>

					<p>Whether it is in academia or industry, in computer simulations or at a physical bench, electronics engineering is centered around lab work. Thus, while undergraduate students might expect to sit passively in a lecture, when they enter my classroom, they are learning to live the lab experience. This is not to say my only teaching experience is in lab courses, although I have served as a TA in such settings. Rather, I view every component of instruction as an opportunity for lab activity.</p>

				<div class="details">

					<p>Why? Because the lab is the setting that best captures the key learning goals of engineering as a whole: students must use their theoretical knowledge to build a solution to an engineering problem, then characterize their design using appropriate measurements, and finally communicate the results to other engineers. Explicit in this process is the requirement that students <em>produce something</em>, which is a more difficult and more meaningful task than the passive understanding and identification of concepts associated with a lecture.</p>

					<h3 class="emphasis">My Role: Mentorship at Difficult Moments</h3>

					<p>Structuring classroom activities as lab exercises was not necessarily an obvious choice in my pedagogical development. I am a natural explainer of difficult concepts. It gives me great satisfaction to dive deeply into a textbook to make sense of how math & physics are applied to create useful engineering designs, and then take this knowledge to the lab. Thus, my own approach to learning has always been one of constant reflection and self-explanation. The key challenge, however, that makes teaching so fascinating for me, is that it requires me to explain to an audience <em>other than myself</em>: students who enter my classroom with different academic backgrounds, different levels of privilege, different study habits and organizational strategies, and different educational goals.</p>
				</div>

			<div class="block multi-bot">

				<div class="details">

					<p>This motivates me to intentionally craft activities that put the student in the role of engineer in the lab; ultimately, they will learn to produce their own explanations linking the theory, the tools, and their own cognition. My role, then, becomes more one of mentorship: there will be moments in the lab when an engineer (at any level) becomes stuck, and at these moments, I use my explanatory skills to provide insight based on my own disciplinary experience.</p>

				<div class="details">

					<p>The work I have done developing a computer processor simulation project for first-year undergraduates serves as a model of my lab-centered approach to syllabus and lesson plan design. I began by identifying learning objectives for the independent design assignments, which are the most obvious lab activities. From there, I determined what skills and background knowledge students would need.</p>

					<p>When I first taught this project, I prepared detailed lecture notes and focused on content in the classroom. The pace was often too fast or too slow, depending on the student, and when it was time to complete the independent design assignments, many were lost. Instead, I now organize the project into three parts.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="context">
					<p>See my <a href="syllabi.html">original syllabus</a>.</p>
				</div>
				
			</div>

			<div class="block multi-mid">

				<div class="details">

					<ul>
						<li>First, students digest the background content at their own pace, in asynchronous modules I designed that include text, video, and practice quizzes. In the future, when teaching a complete course, I would prepare full video lectures for greater cohesion, while still incorporating short quizzes to reinforce the most recent material. Videos could also include recitation-style modeling of problem-solving techniques.</li>
						<li>Second, synchronous class time is spent bridging the gap between theory and practice; each lesson includes one or more individual or group activities that explore key design challenges. Problem sets would fall in this category, and would take place as classwork instead of homework. Exams (ideally low-stakes and frequent) can also be viewed as lab-like classroom learning experiences.</li>
						<li>Finally, students apply the skills developed in the classroom to complete their independent design assignments, which for this project include circuit schematic/simulation and programming, and in the future would also encompass in-person lab sessions for hardware prototyping.</li>
					</ul>

				<div class="details">

					<p>With this model, although students are sometimes reluctant to engage in a less familiar classroom style, they go into their independent work better prepared, and ultimately produce more complete designs. In addition, the three-part structure allows me to provide more scaffolding for frequent, small-stakes assignments, helping keep students on track.</p>

					<h3 class="emphasis">The Inclusive Lab</h3>

					<p>My current approach to inclusivity is centered around curating content in multiple forms, allowing multiple forms of participation, and providing multiple opportunities for instructor help. The course structure is also key to my approach, since the asynchronous presentation of content allows students to absorb the material at their own pace. This flexible schedule is especially important given that I want to include students with different levels of background knowledge (for example, not expecting all students to have had high school exposure to programming); instead, I use a pre-project survey to gauge student backgrounds.</p>

				<div class="details">

					<p>Although I already spend time explaining to the students how the course components fit together, and identifying learning objectives, I do have some room to improve in being transparent about my pedagogical choices; the evidence shows that active learning is more effective when students are on board with the process. In addition, I intend to implement more strategies to build intrinsic motivation; while my current students have chosen to participate in the project, often the underlying reason is simply their choice of intended major. Pushing them to express what about the discipline is appealing to them will help better define their own educational goals in the project, and strengthen their buy-in. In a future course, I would also provide students the option to complete a subset of available labs, based on their unique interests.</p>

				<div class="details">

					<p>When instructing a full course, I intend to take transparency further, working with the students to develop policies at the beginning of the semester for class conduct, peer collaboration, recommended (and prohibited) online resources, and the types of questions encouraged in office hours and on the class discussion forum. Many students, especially early in their college careers, still feel a stigma around office hours. One strategy I have experimented with to encourage student questions is turning it into an assignment. After a lesson, the students were told “you have to ask a question,” along with a few possible question styles. Thus, I was able to gauge post-lesson student understanding (and follow up) without forcing a single student to publicly express a point of confusion in front of their peers.</p>

					<p>Despite not having a role in which I assess student participation for a grade, I am conscious of students’ different engagement styles. In classwork, students might be comfortable sharing out answers to the class, or find small group discussions more manageable, or prefer to focus on notes; all are part of the activities that I design. When I have the opportunity to assess participation, I would do this as a mid-semester consultation with each student, in which they can self-assess their comfort with various forms of participation, and together we can identify areas of growth to be revisited at a final consultation. These meetings could be framed using a 1-point rubric, checking for the student’s use of each possible engagement strategy This rubric would also be a document discussed and amended with the students, fully including them in the establishment of classroom norms and expectations.</p>
