				<h2>Evidence of Teaching Efficacy</h2>

				<p>Here I have curated feedback on my teaching from several sources. Student responses include anonymous opinions from end-of-semester evaluations, as well as comments on my teaching or <a href="syllabi.html">the project</a> made in graded final project reflections. Also included are thoughts from the lead professor for The Art of Engineering, and excerpts from a peer observation report prepared as part of our work in the <a href="https://ctl.columbia.edu/graduate-instructors/opportunities-for-graduate-students/teaching-observation-fellows/">Teaching Observation Fellowship</a>. Stay tuned for quantitative evidence. I have organized the feedback into topics, which touch on some of the major themes of my <a href="tstatement.html">teaching statement</a>.</p>

				<p>Unless otherwise noted, all feedback refers to my work from Fall 2019 to Spring 2023 on the <a href="syllabi.html">computer engineering project</a> for first-year undergraduates. Participation in this project varied from 10-60 students, depending on the semester.</p>

					<p>My peer observer remarked that <em>"Caleb showed an eager responsiveness to student questions and always used students’ input to build and deepen further understanding around a topic...His explanations and responses to the questions that students posed showed his knowledge of the subject and his commitment to effectively communicating it to students just entering the field of computer engineering."</em></p>

					<p><em>"This project made me actually excited to major in computer engineering!"</em></p>

					<p><em>"I don’t believe that more computer engineering lies in my educational future. That said, I feel that I am a better computer scientist for knowing exactly how our computers are constructed and the limitations that they impose."</em></p>

					<p><em>"I am really glad to have chosen this department project. As a prospective computer science major, I have to admit I was a little nervous after the first class. This would push me out of my comfort zone, and force me to understand the computer beneath the code…I will definitely look into taking a full class on computer engineering in the future, as this department project was extremely enjoyable. Thank you!"</em></p>

					<p><em>"I have never liked the idea of building processors, circuits, logic and all that, but the amazing experience of working on this project has made me seriously consider studying more about this stuff in college. That would never have happened if I didn’t step out of my comfort zone to try something new by signing up for this project. Thank you for your time, commitment and excellent teaching! This project has and will have a lasting effect on me. I’m extremely grateful and keep up the good work."</em></p>

				<div class="context">
					<p>Since there is no separate computer science project in The Art of Engineering, a common challenge I face involves engaging students who are only interested in software, and might find the processor design project lacking in relevance. Fortunately, I frequently see comments in students' final reflections such as those included here, in which software-oriented students acknowledge the value of the more hardware-focused project.</p>
