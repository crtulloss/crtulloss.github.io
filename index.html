				<h2>About Me</h2>

				<p>I am an electronics engineer specializing in analog & mixed-signal integrated circuit design. I recently started a new job at Draper Lab in Cambridge, MA, where I am excited to work on application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) designs in support of solutions for critical national challenges.</p>

				<p>Previously, I was a graduate student at Columbia University, where I earned Master of Science and Master of Philosophy degrees in Electrical Engineering. As a member of the Bioelectronic Systems Lab, I worked on a multichannel probe-agnostic signal conditioning ASIC for mouse-model neuroscience research. I am most proud of my designs for a low-noise amplifier and a switched-capacitor bandpass filter.</p>

				<p>I love teaching electronics, and during my time at Columbia, I completed the advanced track of the <a href="https://ctl.columbia.edu/graduate-instructors/programs-for-graduate-students/ctl-teaching-development-program/">Teaching Development Program</a>. I was thrilled to have the opportunity to develop and instruct a new computer engineering project for first-year introductory course The Art of Engineering. Please check out my <a href="teaching.html">teaching portfolio</a> to learn more about my pedagogical development.</p>

				<p>For my undergraduate honors thesis at Brown University, I developed a benchtop prototype for untethered primate eye orientation tracking using resonant coupling. I also spent my post-bac summer designing temperature and supply voltage sensors for system-on-chip applications.</p>

				<p>In my spare time, I enjoy most forms of exercise, especially tennis, running, biking, and hiking. I also play Romantic-period classical piano and brew my own kombucha.</p>
